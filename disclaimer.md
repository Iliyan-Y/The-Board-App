The utilization of this application is intended to align with ethical standards and is not intended for surreptitious or dishonest purposes. It is advised against using this application as a brute force tool for job applications. The suggestion is that if a job application process can be automated to such an extent, it implies a potential flaw in the prevailing procedures utilized by companies and recruiters for candidate selection. Emphasis is placed on the recommendation that companies and recruiters should prioritize assessing individuals' character through engaging and forthright conversations rather than relying on facile, memorized responses to repetitive questions. The use of predefined questions is cautioned against, as it often results in predetermined answers, limiting the depth and authenticity of candidate evaluations.
